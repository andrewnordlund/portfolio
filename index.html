			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I'm a programmer with an emphasis on web accessibility.  By day, I have over ten years experience in auditing websites against WCAG, and now I'm a COBOL programmer on a large financial application.  By night, I have a plethora of side projects and hobby sites/apps.</p>
			<p>Despite my emphasis on accessibility, I am a developer, not a designer.  I can make it work.  I probably can't make it pretty.</p>
			<p>This site is a place where I can link to everything all in one place, or at least describe it.</p>

			<h2>Personal Projects</h2>
			<p>Many of these are a work-in-progress.  Is software ever really finsihed?</p>
